This project analyzes the win percentages of the New York Giants (NYG) and New York Jets (NYJ) from the 2005 season onward, using data scraped from Wikipedia. The script uses Python libraries such as Pandas for data extraction and cleaning, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Regex for text processing. The dataset is cleaned by selecting relevant columns, converting data types, and filtering by season. The win percentage is then calculated based on the number of wins, losses, and ties for each season. The final visualization compares the win percentages of both teams over time, providing insights into their performance trends.
